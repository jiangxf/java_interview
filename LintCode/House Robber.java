/*
Description
You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. 
Each house has a certain amount of money stashed, the only constraint stopping you from robbing each of them is that
adjacent houses have security system connected and it will automatically contact the police 
if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night.

Given a list of non-negative integers representing the amount of money of each house, 
determine the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight without alerting the police.

Example
Given [3, 8, 4], return 8.

Challenge 
O(n) time and O(1) memory.

/***************************************** Main Idea 1 *****************************************/

/**
 * Approach 1: Sequence DP
 * We can't rob two adjacent houses, and the money of each house must be non-negative.
 * So we could use dp[i] to represent that:
 * the max profit could be robbed form the first i house.
 * The Function is:
 * dp[i] = Math.max(dp[i - 2] + A[i-1], dp[i - 1])
 * The answer is:
 * dp[A.length]
 * <p>
 * Time Complexity: O(n); Space Complexity: O(1)
 * <p>
 * Note: Remember to Initialize the dp array.

        // which couldn't be deduce from previous status.

/**
 * Approach 2: Sequence DP (Optimized By Sliding Array)
 * The current status is determined by dp[i-1] and dp[i-2], we don't care about the other status,
 * so we just need to save the two status.
 * It means that the size of array could be reduce from O(n) to O(2) by using the modulo operator %.
 * So the function is:
 * dp[i % 2] = Math.max(dp[(i-2) % 2] + A[i-1], dp[(i-1) % 2])
 * (i%2 could be optimized as i&1 to speed up the operation)
 * And the result is:
 * dp[A.length % 2]

 * Time Complexity: O(n); Space Complexity: O(1)
