In this problem,we are asked to divide two integers.
        However,we are not allowed to use division,multiplication and mod operations.
        So,what else can we use?Yeah,bit manipulations.

        Let's do an example and see how bit manipulations work.
        Suppose we want to divide 15by 3,so 15is dividend and 3is divisor.
        Well,division simply requires us to find
        how many times we can subtract the divisor from the the dividend without making the dividend negative.

        Let's get started. We subtract 3 from 15 and we get 12, which is positive. Let's try to subtract more.
        Well,we shift 3to the left by 1bit and we get 6.Subtracting 6from 15still gives a positive result.
        Well,we shift again and get 12.We subtract 12from 15and it is still positive.
        We shift again,obtaining 24and we know we can at most subtract 12.
        Well,since 12is obtained by shifting 3to left twice,we know it is 4times of 3.
        How do we obtain this 4?Well,we start from 1and shift it to left twice at the same time.
        We add 4to an answer(initialized to be 0).
        In fact,the above process is like 15=3*4+3.We now get part of the quotient(4),with a remainder 3.

        Then we repeat the above process again.We subtract divisor=3from the remaining dividend=3and obtain 0.
        We know we are done.No shift happens,so we simply add 1<<0to the answer.
        Now we have the full algorithm to perform division.

        According to the problem statement,we need to handle some exceptions,such as overflow.
        Two cases may cause overflow:
        divisor=0;
        dividend=INT_MIN and divisor=-1(because abs(INT_MIN)=INT_MAX+1).
        Of course,we also need to take the sign into considerations,which is relatively easy.

        if (dividend == Integer.MIN_VALUE && divisor == -1) {
            return Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        }

        boolean isNegative = (dividend < 0 && divisor > 0) ||
                (dividend > 0 && divisor < 0);
        long a = Math.abs((long) dividend);
