/*
Description
Given n numbers, now we need to merge n numbers into one number.
And each time we can only select and merge two numbers a,b. Each merger needs to consume a+b energy.
Output the minimum energy consumed by merging n numbers.

Notice
2 <= n <= 50000, the combined number will not exceed the int range

Example
Given [1,2,3,4], return 19
Explanation:
Merge 1,2, which consumes 3 energy, and the rest is [3,4,3]. Merge 3,3, which consumes 6 energy, and the rest is [6,4].
Merge the last two numbers, which consumes 10 energy, and a total of 19 energy was consumed.

Given [2,8,4,1], return 25
explanation:
Merge 1,2, which consumes 3 energy, and the rest is [8,4,3]. Merge 3,4, which consumes 7 energy, and the rest is [7,8].
Merge the last two numbers, which consumes 15 energy, and a total of 25 energy was consumed.

 * Approach: Greedy
 * 显然每次选择当前的最小的两个数进行合并的答案是最优的.
 * 因此使用一个优先队列，小根堆，每次选堆顶的两个元素进行合并，然后再扔进堆里即可.
 * 时间复杂度O(nlogn).
